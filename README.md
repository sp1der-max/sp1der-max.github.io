# HOW TO BEFRIEND A CAT?

## What is a cat? 

The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.

The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language.

## How do you befriend a stray cat?

Cats that are used to being around people and being approached and petted will become your friend easily and quickly.

Cats that have had less than stellar relationships with humans will be anything from more timid to downright hostile.

## 0. If you have no intentions of being nice to a cat, just pass by and leave them alone. No one will like you for being down right **abusive** to an innocent animal who doesn't even care about you.


## 1. Let them come to you

When making friends with a cat, the most important role is to do everything on their terms. Be patient. Forcing your affection on them will only stress them out, and even if they stay put, they won't necessarily enjoy the attention you're lavishing on them. It may take some time, but wait for them to approach you first and always give them the opportunity to flee if they so desire. Be a decent human being and learn what consent means.



## 2. Be small and quiet

A cat will be frightened by a human towering over them, so sit down criss-cross apple sauce on the floor or in a nearby chair to make yourself less frightening. Similarly, any loud noises or sudden movements may frighten the cat (hold that cough that you desperately want to let out. _**Hold it.**_), so move slowly and quietly around them, but don't sneak up on them if they aren't aware of your presence. 



## 3. Slow blink at them

When the cat is looking at you, avoid staring back at them as this may make them more nervous _(Or do not do this to anyone at all. It's Creepy-)_. Try slowly blinking your eyes at them instead. This shows them that you have enough faith in them to close your eyes in their presence, which is a big deal for a cat. Hopefully, they will reciprocate by slowly blinking back, indicating that they trust you as well. (A privilege, truly.)



## 4. Offer out a hand

If the cat appears to be at ease around you, try holding out your hand like the Michaelangelo painting, The creation of Adam, a few inches to the side to see if they sniff it. Maintain your distance and keep an eye on the cat's body language. They may still be unsure if their weight is shifted to their front or back legs, and any further contact may startle them. If their body language is more neutral and they rub their face against you, this is a good sign because they will be marking you with their own scent (which only cats can smell) through glands in their cheeks. After that, you can give them a gentle head rub or chin stroke. Be patient and do not smother them with unwanted affection.



## 5. Don't touch their tummy.

The cat may roll over onto its back and show you its tummy once it has become friendly with you. Try not to touch their tummy when they do this, no matter how tempting it is _(It's a trap)_. They're letting you know they trust you enough not to touch their tummy, so going in for a stroke would be the **ultimate betrayal**. You can expect new red line tattoos and bloodshed. Instead, simply stroke their head or chin to express your mandatory gratitude for the gesture.



## 6. Encourage them to play.

Some cats may not want to be stroked, but they may enjoy playing games with you instead _(Literally. They will charm you like a minx so you can bend down to their will.)_. To see if they stalk something, slowly move a fishing rod toy across the floor a meter or two away from them, or slowly bat a ping pong ball towards them. Playing with cats releases happy hormones in their brains, so it's a great way to bond with them and may eventually lead to head bumps! If you don't have any toys, just simply use anything available. Crumpled papers, hair ties or a pen will suffice.
